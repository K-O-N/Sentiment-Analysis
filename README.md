# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Classification on Tweets Dataset Using Machine Learning
## Summary:
This notebook focuses on classifying the sentiment of tweets into positive and negative categories using six different machine learning classifiers. The analysis involves:

Data Preprocessing: Importing and cleaning the dataset to prepare it for sentiment analysis.
Visualization: Using libraries like TextBlob, WordCloud, and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data distribution and word usage.
Modeling: Implementing six classifiers for sentiment prediction, evaluating their performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimization: Adjusting model parameters to enhance performance.
Documentation: Providing clear commentary and explanation for every step to ensure the workflow is understandable for non-technical audiences.
The objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline, showcasing the comparative effectiveness of various classifiers and their suitability for real-world applications
